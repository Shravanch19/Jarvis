   - Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities.
   - Contextual understanding and conversation handling.

2. **Machine Learning**
   - Personalized responses based on user preferences and behavior.
   - Predictive analytics for proactive assistance.
   - Continuous learning from user interactions.

3. **Computer Vision**
   - Facial recognition for personalized greetings and security.
   - Object detection and tracking.
   - Gesture recognition for hands-free interaction.

4. **Task Automation**
   - Schedule management (calendar integration, reminders).
   - Home automation (smart device control).
   - Email and message handling.

5. **Information Retrieval**
   - Web scraping for real-time information.
   - Integration with databases and APIs for comprehensive data access.
   - Summarization of documents and articles.

6. **Security and Privacy**
   - End-to-end encryption for communication.
   - User authentication and role-based access control.
   - Data anonymization and secure storage.
